📱 - Made on Android through Termux and Acode (which means some things may go wrong!)<br />
🔌 - An unknown feature about Minecraft: Bedrock Edition is the websocket feature, accessible with `/connect` or `/wsserver`. This tries to use that feature in order to bring "mods" in forms of websockets into Minecraft Bedrock Edition
